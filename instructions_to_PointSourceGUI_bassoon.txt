%GUI with Matlabs guide for the point source modelling software
%Bassoon version with 14 editable sources
%Timo Grothe, ETI, 30.05.2022
%
% Requires: 
% -PointSourceGUI_bassoon.m    => the Matlabscript for GUI control
% -PointSourceGUI_bassoon.fig  => the Matlab figure file with the GUI 
% -PointSourceClass.m          => a Matlab class definition for a point source     
% -PointSourceClassD.m         => a Matlab class definition for a directional source
%
% Required additional data files: 
% -param_<freq>Hz.csv , where freq = 176,612,940,1520 => source parameters for 14 bassoon tone holes, organized in a .csv table file
% ==
% Optional bassoon data files:
% -param(ow)_<freq>Hz.csv , where freq = 176,612,940,1520 => source
% parameters for 14 bassoon tone holes, organized in a .csv table file,
% computed with a different waveguide model
%
% Optional demo file
% -dipole_80Hz => a file that can be used as a template for custom source definitions.
%
% INSTRUCTIONS
% To run the GUI, make sure that all required files are in the same
% folder. 
% 1) Open PointSourceGUI_bassoon.m in a Matlab editor
% 2) Run the file in Matlab
% OBJECTIVE
% With the GUI figure that opens, you can visualize bassoon radiation data
% as calculated by the point source model described in Kob et al.
% "Simulation and interpretation of wind instrument directivity using a
% point source approach" (Manuscript to be submitted to Acta Acustica)
% LOAD PRESETS
% By clicking the checkboxes, you can compare the simulated radiation pattern of a bassoon fingered F3 (175 Hz)
% in three different model flavors ("PS", "WG", "WG+CA"), at four different frequencies.
% These models directly relate to the data shown in Fig.6 of the accompanying manuscript.
% Having loaded one of these presets by checking one of the checkboxes, you can modify
% the source parameters freely to see how this affects the radiation
% pattern. 
% INTERACTION WITH THE GUI
% The model is instantaneously updated, such that any modification of the
% parameters in the GUI is directly plotted. 
% Geometry: In the edit fields, you can type the source position (coordinates x,y,z).
% Excitation: With the sliders, you can modify each sources strength (Q) an acoustical distance(D) by +/- 100%.
% Frequency: You can also vary the frequency of the model with the slider.
% View: You may freely change the view on the ballon radiation plot by use of the rotate- and tilt-sliders.
% PRINT
% Click the print button to make a pdf print of the current model.
% SAVE TO FILE
% Click the save to file button to store the current model in MATLABS *.fig- file format. Opening this file in Matlab allows to change the view, e.g. by rotate and tilt.
% RESET
% To compare these bassoon radiation data to a simpler radiator, you can click on the "reset to line array" button,
% which loads a line array with 14 regularly spaced sources, symmetrically
% aligned along the y-axis. 7 sources are left and the other 7 sources
% right of the origin. Sources within these two groups are synchronous, but the
% phase shift between the two groups is pi.
% CUSTOM SOURCES
% To test a specific model, you can set up a csv- table with custom source
% parameters. The convention for such a table is: each source is definte by five parametres
% in a row: the fist three indicate the position (x,y,z), and the latter two the excitation
% (source strength Q, and acoustical distance D) (for details see
% PointSourceClass.m). The filename can be chosen freely, a file ending
% suffix _1234Hz.csv will set the initial modeling frequency on the slider to 1234 Hz.
% To match the GUI, you will need to set 14 source (set the source strength to 0 if you need less than 14 sources).
% As a template, the file dipole_80Hz.csv shows a parameter table for a dipole. 
% COMPARISON TO MEASUREMENTS
% We provide measurement data of balloon directivity in form of Matlabs .fig format, for flue pipe (flp) and bassoon (bsn) at several discrete frequenencies as indicated in the filename. For bassoon, data from two different fingerings (340 = MIDI 34 => Bb1, f0 = 58Hz; 530 = MIDI 53 => F3, f0 = 175Hz) is given.
The balloons in bsn340_*.fig are shown in the left column of FIG.2 in the manuscript.
The balloons in flp_*.fig are shown in the left column of FIG.4 in the manuscript.
The balloons in bsn530_*.fig are shown in the left column of FIG.6 in the manuscript.
